        It's been 26 months (and more) since we've been together. We've been
        through a lot, both good and bad. But I'm glad we went made it through.
        Thank you for always being there. Sorry for being too emotional or 
        unreasonable sometimes. I'm trying to improve that about myself, and 
        I'll try my best naka :((. I still love you so much like I was two 
        years ago. Thank you for doing everything for me and for us as well.
        <br><br>
        26 months passed by really fast. It's quite unbelievable that we made it
        this far, but it's a good thing though. I want to be better both emotionally
        and physically, and I'll try my best. Please keep believing in yourself that 
        you are a great, wonderful, and talented person. Because I believe and see that 
        you are and always have been. If there's anything you want to improve, we could
        always do it together, and I'll be there by your side.😳❤
        <br><br>
        Also, I'm sorry for these inconsistency in gifts. I'll try to be more
        consistent with them. Sorry for everything and sadness that I've done to you.
        Thank you so much for everything you gave me.
        <br><br>
        Hope you like this gift :). Love you the most always. XOXO <br>
        I'm here and will always be.🌸❤🦋
